# Project-II-Exposure

Xposure is a photo app that allows the user to look up various locations and see what photos people have taken by using the Unplash Api. The user must create a profile inorder for them to save a location in their collections. The user can also edit and delete a current location from their collection as well. 

The target group for this application is for anyone who is looking for photo inspiration when they're traveling to a new location. The user can quickly use Xposure to enter in a destination and the application will render high quality photos using the Unsplash API. Ultimately allowing the user to get inspired by photos people are taking within the area as well as finding more places to shoot.  


## Instagram Vs Xposure 
Instagram renders there photos by 1080px in width by 1080px in height when uploaded onto their application regardless of the size of the photo. 

Unfortunately, decreasing image resolution and increasing image compression are one-way streets. Once you make the change, thereâ€™s no going back. 

Unplash allows the user to upload high quality photos with px freedom. Many of the images rendered on the Unplash API have the dimensions of 3000 and above. Delivering larger, crisper, and high quality photos to the user.
